 <h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Olena</h1>
<p align="center">
 I am a Full-stack Developer with a Master's Degree in Finance with honors and a background in sales. Over three years, I managed my own online leisure goods store (here I processed 2000+ orders) and even developed a website for it using HTML, SCSS, Gulp, Swiper API, and CMS WordPress. Seeking to advance my expertise, I expanded my knowledge by mastering CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, and Node.js in professional IT courses. I am committed to continuous improvement and plan to learn Vue.js and Angular to enhance further my ability to create dynamic and responsive web applications.
